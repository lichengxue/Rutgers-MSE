## `bsb_mse_example_01.R`

This is a brief explanation of the example MSE used for black sea bass.
The model sets up a 3 year long MSE with assessments every 3 years. This is 
preceded by 35 years of historical data (1989 to 2023) after which the MSE 
takes over. The population is structured as two meta-stocks that have movement 
between each other. 

$$\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right)
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)$$
